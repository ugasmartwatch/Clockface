Jan 11-18th: Created a clockface but could not load during the meeting. Lost the code.

Jan 18-19th: The watch was not working properly and always in booting status. Dr. Johnsen helped to fix the problem.

Jan 20-25th: Created another clockface and showed Dr. Johnsen how it worked.

Jan 26-31th: Brainstormed and made initialization on a web page for parent to make reminders on the watch.

Feb 1-4th: Researched about collecting and saving information from the web interface.

           Another idea about the web page: could has a collection of each child's schedule
           
           And/or: patterns of the reminders (i.e. different or the same for every day, difference of weekdays and weekend)
           
Feb 5-13th: Hard code reminder message and alarm through website. Can't collect and parse data into sched libraries.
Feb 14th: Tried to call E.showMessage and E.showPrompt to parse the messgae data. Still cannot figure out how to parse the time to sched.js
